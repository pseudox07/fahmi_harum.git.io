					<p>
						Text summarization is one of the branches in NLP, it is a process of extracting the information from a text and summarizing it into a small chunk of text. There are two types of text summarization which are abstractive summarization and extractive summarization. Abstractive summarization is concerned about the semantic understanding of every word in a text. While extractive summarization weighs the important part of a sentence by ranking it with scores. This project implements the Extraction summarization approach where the definition meets the objective of the project which identifies the important points from the newspaper articles. The summary will be generated from the top rank of sentences that have the high sentence scores. For this research project, we will develop an algorithm to summarize newspaper articles.
